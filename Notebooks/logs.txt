It seems like you're trying to access data from a table named 'account_template', which doesn't exist in your Postgres database schema. The correct column names for this query would be 'id', 'model_id', and possibly others depending on the actual structure of your tables, but without knowing those details it's hard to provide an accurate SQL statement. 

Please check if there is a table named 'account_template'. If not you can create one by using below command:  
CREATE TABLE account_template (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name VARCHAR(255), description TEXT);    ## This will generate an auto incrementing primary key id. You may need to adjust it according your needs.  If you don't want the 'name', and only use 'description'. In that case replace `VARCHAR` with just a comma: ', description VARCHAR(255)');

If your intention is to select all fields (columns) of an entry in the account template, then try using SELECT * FROM account_template; This will return every field for that row if it exists or nothing otherwise depending on whether there are any entries with 'account_template'.

It seems like you're trying to access data from a table named 'account_template', but PostgreSQL doesn't recognize this as such. If your intention is to select all fields (columns) of an entry in the account template, then it should be something along these lines: 
SELECT * FROM account_template; This will return every field for each row found within that table. Please ensure you have correct column names and also check if there are any spelling mistakes or case sensitivity issues as this might cause errors depending on your database schema design.
