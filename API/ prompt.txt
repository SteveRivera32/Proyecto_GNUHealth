gnuhealth_patient_disease stores disease cases.

Each disease case has a pathology foreign key linking to gnuhealth_pathology, which stores the disease names.

The column gnuhealth_pathology.name contains the name of the disease.

Please generate a SQL query that:

Counts the number of times each disease (from gnuhealth_pathology.name) appears in gnuhealth_patient_disease.

Groups the results by disease name.

Orders the results by count in descending order.

Table aliases:

disease = gnuhealth_patient_disease

pathology = gnuhealth_pathology

SQL output should be:

Column 1: disease name (pathology.name)

Column 2: number of cases
